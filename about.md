### Surgenado is a method for increasing pressure on variable pricing mechanisms in networked marketplaces without impacting the customer's quality of service or the service provider's cumulative earnings.

1. The Surgenado method is constructed on two key assumptions.
    1. Price multipliers in price multiplier governed marketplaces are weighted towards ensuring supply by de-incentivizing demand over incentivizing supply and therefore are overly sensitive to reductions in supply.
    2. In a maturing high-growth marketplace where growth was sustained through aggressive financial incentives, there exists an exploitable gap between the base price and the price at which price aversion negatively impacts demand.
2. Surgenado.com/{{ site.title }} is the apparatus for implementing the Surgenado method in the {{ site.title }} market
    1. Participation intervals are initially scheduled in 30 minute blocks staggered at 15 minute intervals.
    3. As the Surgenado gains momentum, website analytics are used to analyze and shape participation intervals to increase impact.
    3. Surgenado operates as an organizational tool until a critical momentum is achieved wherein it shifts into an operational mode.
