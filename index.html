    <h1 class="page-heading">

  <h1 class="center-text">Choose your category</h1>
  <h3 class="center-text">.</a></h3>
  <h1 class="center-text"><a href="no.html">Category 0</a></h1>
  <h1 class="page-heading center-text">
  Category 0 participants take the hourly guarantee. This is A-OK! Surgenado is about empowering the contractors and hourly guarantees represent a concession from management, albeit a temporary one.</h1>
  <h1 class="center-text"><a href="welcome.html">Category 1</a></h1>
  <h1 class="page-heading center-text">
    Category 1 participants are essential as they provide the data to start calibrating for the bigger Surgenados. Unfortunately Category 1 participants will earn less while non-participants earn more.
  </h1>
  <h1 class="center-text"><a href="welcome.html">Category 2</a></h1>
  <h1 class="page-heading center-text">
    Category 2 is a better starting point for most than Category 1, it requires less of a sacrafice and will generate media coverage in addition to calibrating the system.
  </h1>
  <h1 class="center-text"><a href="welcome.html">Category 3</a></h1>
  <h1 class="page-heading center-text">
    Category 3 is where participants maintain earnings while working less allowing for it to be maintained indefinitely mitigateing the need for marketplace management to acknowledge contractor activity.
  </h1>
  <h1 class="center-text"><a href="welcome.html">Category 4</a></h1>
  <h1 class="page-heading center-text">
    Category 4 is where price aversion starts impacting individual contractor earnings. Regardless of participation, all contractors will experience earning fluxuations. The benefit of Category 4 is that the price aversion also reduces overall marketplace volume, impacting the management's commission based revenue stream.

  <h1 class="center-text"><a href="welcome.html">Category 5</a></h1>
  <h1 class="page-heading center-text">
    Category 5 is a massive disruption of marketplace operations, permanently altering the balance of power.
