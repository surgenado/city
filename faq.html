<h2>What is a Surgenado?</h2>
<h1 class="page-heading">
  <ol>
    <li>Surgenado is a method for elevating the unit price of services rendered in price multipler governed marketplaces without impacting the quality of service or cumulative contractor earnings.</li>
    <li>The Surgenado method is constructed on two key assumptions.
      <ol>
        <li>Price multipliers in price multiplier governed marketplaces are weighted towards ensuring supply by deincentivizing demand and therefore are overly sensitive to reductions in supply.</li>
        <li>In maturing high-growth marketplaces where growth was sustained through aggressive financial incentives, there is an exploitable gap between the base price and the price at which price aversion negatively impacts demand.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Surgenado.com/{{ site.title }} is the apparatus for implementing the Surgenado method in the {{ site.title }} market</li>
    <li>Contractor unavailabilty is initially scheduled in 30 minute blocks staggered at 15 minute intervals.
    <br>As the Surgenado gains momentum, website analytics are used to analyze and then shape participation patterns to increase impact.</li>
    <li>Surgenado.com functions as an organizational tool until a critical momentum is achieved when it shifts into an operational mode.</li>
