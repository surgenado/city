<h2>What is a Surgenado?</h2>
<h1 class="page-heading">
  <ol>
    <li>Surgenado is a method for empowering free scheduled contractors in a price multipler governed marketplace by impacting the unit price of the service rendered without reducing the quality of service or cumulative contractor earnings.</li>
    <li>The Surgenado method is constructed on two key assumptions.
      <ol>
        <li>Price multipliers in price multiplier governed marketplaces are weighted towards ensuring supply by deincentivizing demand and therefore are overly sensitive to reductions in supply.</li>
        <li>In maturing high-growth marketplace where growth was sustained through aggressive financial incentives, the buffer between the base price and the price where price aversion negatively impacts demand is significant.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Surgenado.com/{{ site.title }} is an apparatus for implementing the Surgenado method in local markets by coordinating contractors locally</li>
    <li>In its base configuration, contractor unavailabilty is scheduled in 30 minute blocks staggered at 15 minute intervals.
    <br>As the Surgenado builds strength, website analytics will be used to analyze the pattern of participating contractors allowing for the Surgenado to be shaped for greater impact.</li>
  </ol>
